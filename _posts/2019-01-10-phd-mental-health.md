title: Nine ideas for improving PhD student mental health
---

My [piece](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/phds-without-tears-how-academics-can-help-ease-students-minds) on PhD student mental health was published in Times Higher Education. (They graciously allowed me to provide a [version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHUCJ_DUwzx-8M-uzOgCL0bNfVE6Tba5NMXxn5KfVbE/edit?usp=sharing) that you can read and share without registering.) Thanks very much to the hundreds of PhD students who shared their stories and the many academics who provided feedback on the piece.
